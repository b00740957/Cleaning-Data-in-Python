# Cleaning-Data-in-Python

Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. 

- Exploring the data: diagnose issues such as outliers, missing values, and duplicate rows.

- Tidying data for analysis: reshape and tidy the data using pivoting and melting.

- Combining data for analysis: combine the data using concating and merging. 

- Cleaning data for analysis: use string manipulation and pattern matching to deal with unstructured data, explore techniques to deal with missing or duplicate data, then programmatically check the data for consistency.

- Case study: apply all of the data cleaning techniques owards tidying a real-world, messy dataset obtained from the Gapminder Foundation.
