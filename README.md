# Cleaning-Data-in-Python

Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. 

- Exploring the data: use python to diagnose issues such as outliers, missing values, and duplicate rows.

- Tidying data for analysis: reshape and tidy the data using techniques such as pivoting and melting.

- Combining data for analysis: combine the data using concating and merging. 

- Cleaning data for analysis: use string manipulation and pattern matching to deal with unstructured data, and then explore techniques to deal with missing or duplicate data. Use assert to programmatically check your data for consistency.

- Case study: apply all of the data cleaning techniques owards tidying a real-world, messy dataset obtained from the Gapminder Foundation.
